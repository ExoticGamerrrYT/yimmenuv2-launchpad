## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Process not found" error:**

- Ensure GTA V is fully loaded (not just starting up)
- Make sure you're using the correct platform (Epic/Steam/Rockstar)
- Try running the launchpad as administrator

**"DLL not found" error:**

- Check that antivirus isn't blocking the download and re-inject

**Injection fails:**

- Check if BE is disabled for you platform
- Run the launchpad as administrator
- Temporarily disable antivirus software
- Ensure no other mod menus are already injected

**Game won't launch:**

- Verify the game platform is correctly selected
- Check that the respective launcher (Steam/Epic/Rockstar) is installed
- Try launching the game manually first
